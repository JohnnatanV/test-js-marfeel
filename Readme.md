## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### Process

The first step i take to start the solution of the test was to start a decomposition of the screenshot to understan how is the structure and what i need for the base of the application, my initial move was to structure the HTML, then start developing the component in Javascript when the component start working needed to work in the chart, have some compication for the d3.js library but was no big issue, for the local server i used XAMPP and http-server from NPM,
